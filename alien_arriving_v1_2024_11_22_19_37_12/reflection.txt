"ARRIVAL" is a game I created that imagines the future of an alien encounter. The player takes on the role of a curious girl (would be me if this happens...) who attempts to make peace by physically meeting the alien robot and jellyfish.

The game has 6 scenes, with each round lasting 1.5 minutes. The player earns 1 point for making contact with the alien robot or jellyfish. However, if the girl hits a bomb, 1 point is deducted, though the score will always remain above 0.

If the player accumulates 10 points within the playtime, they win the game and a dialogue begins between the girl and the aliens. If the player does not reach 10 points, they lose.

The graphics and music for the game were sourced and credited at the bottom of the code. While I enjoyed creating the game, I had to change the original concept halfway through development. It was a great way to apply concepts learned that semester, though I did face some challenges with the collision detection and certain functions.

Overall, it was a great experience. I also never realized how important background music and sound effects are for a game! They truly bring a game to life.
